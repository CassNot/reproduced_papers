# Algorithm 1: Linear quantum photonic circuits as variational quantum classifiers

This experiment demonstrates the use of linear quantum photonic circuits for binary classification tasks, comparing performance across different photon numbers and circuit architectures.

## Overview

The implementation includes:
- **Multiple VQC architectures**: beam splitter meshes, general interferometers, basic and spiral circuits
- **Three synthetic datasets**: linearly separable, circular, and moon-shaped data
- **Performance comparison**: VQC vs classical methods (MLP, SVM)
- **Decision boundary visualization**: Visual analysis of learned decision boundaries
- **Hyperparameter optimization**: Random search

## Key Results

The experiments validate that **increasing the number of photons increases circuit expressivity**, though higher expressivity can lead to both better and worse results depending on the dataset complexity and training conditions.

## Files Structure

- `VQC.py` - Core VQC implementations and circuit architectures
- `data.py` - Dataset generation and visualization utilities  
- `training.py` - Training loops, evaluation, and visualization functions
- `classical_models.py` - Classical baseline models for comparison
- `run_vqc.py` - Main execution script for experiments
- `run_vqc_hp_search.py` - Hyperparameter search script
- `VQC_classification.ipynb` - Interactive notebook with detailed analysis

## Usage
You should edit the following python files according to your usage:
- run_vqc.py
- run_vqc_hp_search.py
### Quick Start

Run the main experiment:
```bash
python run_vqc.py
```

### Hyperparameter Search

Random search for hyperparameter optimization:
```bash
python run_vqc_hp_search.py
```

### Interactive Analysis

Open the Jupyter notebook for detailed exploration:
```bash
jupyter notebook VQC_classification.ipynb
```

## Results

The experiment generates several visualization outputs:
- **Decision boundaries**: Comparison of VQC and classical model boundaries
- **Performance metrics**: Accuracy comparison across methods and datasets
- **Circuit diagrams**: Visual representation of quantum circuits used

Key findings show that VQCs with more photons have increased expressivity, which can lead to:
- Better performance on some datasets but more challenging optimization on others
- More flexible decision boundaries
- Variable performance compared to classical methods, as increased expressivity complexifies the optimization space
